This code was developed for a client who needed to update specific details such as name and address—in Word documents. However,
they didn’t have time to manually edit the file, rearrange the content, and convert it to PDF. That’s why I created this web application:
it can easily fetch and read text from a Word file, replace it with new text, and generate an updated PDF or Word document.
